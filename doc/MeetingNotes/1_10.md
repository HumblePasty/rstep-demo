# Working Report 1/10

- Project: R-STEP solar siting tool



## Progress Reporting

**To-do List**

Map design

- [ ] Map

  - [ ] data layers imported

- [ ] Data table

  not quite sure what information to be shown here

  more about parcels? more about the layers?

- [ ] Controls

  - [ ] base map control

    to switch between topo base map and satellite base map

  - [ ] draw polygon

  - [ ] layers toggler

- [ ] Summary page, updated each time the polygon changes

  - [ ] basic information
    - [ ] number of parcels included
    - [ ] price
  - [ ] geographic information
    - [ ] elevation
    - [ ] bounding box
  - [ ] distance to substations
  - [ ] distance to transmission line

- [ ] Setback (validation/subtraction)

  This part mainly focus on the spatial process of the solar siting

  Consist of a list of options, click each bottom to validate/subtract the setback and see the adjusted polygon

  - [ ] distance to roads
  - [ ] distance to buildings
  - [ ] distance to electric network
  - [ ] lighting (?)



**Current Questions**

- not quite sure about the fencing
- lighting - what is dark-sky friendly
- sound - what should be considered as sound source



**Notes**

- Michigan new law passed and effect in 

  gives the developers 233

  permitting 

  local service / work with the state

  ordinance 

- Rev tool renewable energy points

  national models usually not 

  local property tax rates
